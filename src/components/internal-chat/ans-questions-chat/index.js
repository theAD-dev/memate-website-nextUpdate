      question: "How do I organise chats by project?",

      answer:
        "Each project in Memate can have its own dedicated chat. Just assign team members to the project, and they’ll automatically join the relevant discussion group.",
    },

      question: "Is it possible to control who sees each chat?",
      key: 3,

      question: "Can I share files and links in the chat?",
      key: 4,

    },
    {
      question: "Is the Internal Chat secure?",
      key: 7,
      answer:
        "Yes, all chats are encrypted and contained within your organisation’s private workspace, ensuring your data stays safe.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I search past messages or files in the chat?",
      key: 8,

        "Yes, you can search through chat history to quickly find messages, files, or specific discussions by project or keyword.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to chat history when a project is completed?",
      key: 9,
      answer:
        "The full chat history is archived with the project, so you can always go back and review past conversations if needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to use any third-party tools for chat?",
      answer:
        "Nope! Memate’s Internal Chat is fully built-in, so you don’t need Slack, WhatsApp, or any other external messaging apps.",
